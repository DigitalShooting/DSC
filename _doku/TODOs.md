## Features

### Animations
Add some animations.

### MongoDB Backend
Sessions have to be saved.

### Backup solution
Maybe a dedicated MongoDB server which we try to connect to.

### Changeing Parts
Changing the active Part should get a config which provides:
- Free mode
- Change bevor first shot
- Disabled

### Logging
Crashed should get logged, also the arrived data from the interface.

### Inner 10
Each Target should have a inner 10 property (Teiler).

### Rest Time Color
The Rest time should get oringe/ red when coming near the end.

### Last shot/ Time over alert
When the last shot was done or the time is over an alert should pop up (auto close/ manual OK Button???)
